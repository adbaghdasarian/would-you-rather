Hello Worl
This is a simple redux web application. All data is stored internally in a data JS file. The client can log in as one of the available users and answer would you rather questions! This is a game and there is a scoreboard based on total answers given and questions asked. New Questions can be asked at /new. The Website cannot be accessed before logging in.


run npm install to begin the application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
